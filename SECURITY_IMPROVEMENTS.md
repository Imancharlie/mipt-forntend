# üîí Security Improvements Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security enhancements implemented in the MiPT Frontend application to protect against various attack vectors and improve overall security posture.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Layers Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Location**: `src/utils/security.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Input sanitization for strings, arrays, and objects
  - XSS prevention through HTML escaping
  - SQL injection pattern blocking
  - File upload validation with type and size restrictions
  - Comprehensive validation rules system

### 2. API Security Enhancements
- **Location**: `src/api/client.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Rate limiting (60 requests per minute per endpoint)
  - URL sanitization to prevent malicious redirects
  - Request data sanitization before sending
  - CSRF protection with nonce generation
  - Response validation to block XSS payloads
  - Reduced timeout (15s) for security
  - Error message sanitization to prevent information leakage

### 3. Security Error Boundary
- **Location**: `src/components/SecurityErrorBoundary.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Catches and handles security-related errors
  - Different UI for security vs. general errors
  - Error reporting capabilities
  - Graceful fallback without exposing sensitive information

### 4. Security Configuration & Policies
- **Location**: `src/utils/securityConfig.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Centralized security policies
  - Password strength requirements
  - File upload restrictions
  - Rate limiting configurations
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) settings
  - Security headers configuration

## üîê Authentication Security

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain uppercase, lowercase, and number
- Maximum 128 characters
- Special character requirement (configurable)

### Session Security
- Secure cookie settings
- HTTP-only cookies
- Same-site strict policy
- Session timeout (30 minutes)
- Maximum concurrent sessions (3)

### Rate Limiting
- Login: 5 attempts per 5 minutes
- Registration: 3 attempts per 10 minutes
- Password reset: 3 attempts per 10 minutes
- API: 100 requests per minute

## üìÅ File Upload Security

### Allowed File Types
- Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- Documents: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT
- Spreadsheets: XLS, XLSX

### Blocked Extensions
- Executables: .exe, .bat, .cmd, .com
- Scripts: .js, .vbs, .php, .asp
- Archives: .jar, .war, .ear

### Size Limits
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Configurable per file type

## üö´ Attack Prevention

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- Input sanitization
- HTML escaping
- Response validation
- CSP headers

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Nonce generation for each request
- Same-site cookie policy
- Origin validation

### SQL Injection
- Pattern-based blocking
- Input sanitization
- Parameterized queries (backend)

### File Upload Attacks
- Type validation
- Extension blocking
- Size restrictions
- Content scanning (configurable)

### Rate Limiting Attacks
- Per-endpoint rate limiting
- Brute force protection
- DDoS mitigation

## üîç Monitoring & Logging

### Security Events Logged
- Failed login attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Security policy violations
- Suspicious activity patterns

### Error Handling
- Sanitized error messages
- No sensitive information leakage
- Security-focused error boundaries
- Graceful degradation

## üöÄ Implementation Guide

### 1. Enable Security Features
The security features are automatically enabled. No additional configuration required.

### 2. Customize Security Policies
Edit `src/utils/securityConfig.ts` to modify:
- Password requirements
- File upload restrictions
- Rate limiting thresholds
- CSP policies

### 3. Monitor Security Events
Security violations are logged to console in development and can be configured for production monitoring.

### 4. Update Security Headers
Security headers are automatically applied through the API client and can be customized in the security config.

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Development
VITE_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Production
VITE_API_URL=https://mipt.pythonanywhere.com/api
VITE_FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Security Levels
- **Development**: Enhanced logging, detailed error messages
- **Production**: Minimal logging, sanitized error messages

## üìä Security Metrics

### What's Protected
- ‚úÖ Input validation and sanitization
- ‚úÖ XSS prevention
- ‚úÖ CSRF protection
- ‚úÖ SQL injection blocking
- ‚úÖ File upload security
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Error information leakage
- ‚úÖ Malicious URL blocking

- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()`

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Violations
1. **Immediate**: Request blocked, user notified
2. **Logging**: Violation logged with timestamp
3. **Monitoring**: Pattern analysis for repeated violations
